Hello! This is my summer project for AP Computer Science A! I chose to clone Worlde with some cool features.
While my teacher said not to spend your whole summer on it, I enjoyed building this project as it allowed me to learn and practice Java
instead of spending hours "learning" in tutorial hell. My C++ skills really helped with this project and using Netbeans is pretty cool.
